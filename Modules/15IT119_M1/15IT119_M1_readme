The tool sage (mathematical wrapper on python) has been used for simple mathematical functions like generating a prime number, inverse modulus function and power exponentiation.

Sage can be downloaded from - http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/sage/index.html
Follow the installation guide to install the software - http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/binary.html#sec-installation-from-binaries

Some of the files have been implemented in python2.
